NAME
    DateTime::Stringify - DateTime objects (no longer needed)

SYNOPSIS
      use DateTime;

      my $dt = DateTime->now;
      print "The time is now $dt...\n";
      # The time is now 2004-02-13T16:12:47...

DESCRIPTION
    The DateTime suite of modules are a comprehensive way of representing
    and manipulating dates and times. This module used to be needed as
    interpolating a DateTime object in a string results in the not-so-useful
    "DateTime=HASH(0x800368)" or similar. However, DateTime has now
    incorporated the functionality of this module (as of DateTime 0.21).
    Thus, this module is no longer needed.

    This module is just a placeholder now. Just use DateTime instead.
