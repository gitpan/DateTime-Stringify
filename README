NAME
    DateTime::Stringify - DateTime objects

SYNOPSIS
      use DateTime;
      use DateTime::Stringify;

      my $dt = DateTime->now;
      print "The time is now $dt...\n";
      # The time is now 2004-02-13T16:12:47...

DESCRIPTION
    The DateTime suite of modules are a comprehensive way of representing
    and manipulating dates and times. However, interpolating a DateTime
    object in a string results in the not-so-useful
    "DateTime=HASH(0x800368)" or similar.

    This module allows DateTime objects interpolated in strings to instead
    print out their $dt->datetime representation (this is also the
    $dt->iso8601 representation). This is probably more suitable for
    programmers (debugging!) than end-users.
